Terminator configurator
1. Reads a list of commands (see command_list_example.txt and replace with your own).
2. Writes configuration file for Terminator.
3. WARNING! Replaces the original Terminator configuration file in the user home folder (~/.config/terminator/config).
4. Opens Terminator with 4, 8, 16 or 32 (default) terminals per window.

If you have the time, refactor function config_file_add_terminals and commit. <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
